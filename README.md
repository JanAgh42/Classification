We have a 2D space that has X and Y dimensions, ranging from -5000 to +5000. There can be points in this space, with each point having a specified position using X and Y coordinates. Each point has unique coordinates (there should not be more than one point in the exact same location). Each point belongs to one of 4 classes, these classes being: red (R), green (G), blue (B) and purple (P). At the beginning, there are 5 points for each class in the space (20 points in total).

The program contains a classifier for new points - in the form of the function classify(int X, int Y, int k), which classifies a new point with coordinates X and Y, adds this point to the 2D space (with color according to the classification) and returns the class it assigned for this point. The k-NN algorithm is used for classification, where k can be 1, 3, 7 or 15.

To demonstrate the classifier, a test environment was created, within which new points are gradually generated and classified (by calling the classify function). A total of 40000 new points are generated (10000 from each class). The coordinates of the new points are generated randomly and each time the new point has a different class (two points generated consecutively do not come from the same class).
